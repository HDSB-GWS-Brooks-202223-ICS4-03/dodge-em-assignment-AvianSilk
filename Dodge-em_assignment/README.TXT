Welcome to my  "Dodge 'em all!" Greenfoot project
------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECT TITLE: "Dodge 'em all!"

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a game consisting of a user-controlled object which has to dodge various obstacles

VERSION or DATE: 12th March 2023

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Open this scenario in Greenfoot and hit "Run"

AUTHORS: Venkata Adapala (@AvianSilk on GitHub)

USER INSTRUCTIONS: The controls and the purpose of the game are in the "Help" section of the game. More importantly, run the game at half the speed since that's what I tuned my values for

GRADING: 
  I think this project deserves a level 4 because
	- User-controlled car with an appropriate background
	- Various obstacles
	- Gets harder and harder (new levels)
	- Obstacles move at random speeds from random places, making it harder
	- Therefore, replayable
	- Score mechanism and display
	- Help screen
	- Clear comments and documentation
