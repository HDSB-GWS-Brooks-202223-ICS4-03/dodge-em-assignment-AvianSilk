# ICS4U Greenfoot Program - Rubric

## Name: 
Dodge 'em all!

## Mini Reflection

Mini-Game Genre:

I think my program is a level 4 because it meets all of the level 3 requirements and some additional level 4 requirements.

The extra features I included in my program are: 
- Obstacles move at random speeds from random places
- New obstacles with different colors pop up after a while
- Although the speeds are randomized, they'll still slowly keep increasing to ensure that the game doesn't feel stagnated at any point
- Score is displayed throughout the game instead of in the end-screen only
- Help screen with instructions on how to play and a button leading directly to the game
- Clear comments and Javadoc documentation

While I tried a couple of other features like adding sound and a high score, I couldn't ultimately do it so the game isn't perfect in my opinion but close.


## The Program [KA]
### Level 3 Requirements

- [X] *“Start Screen” - which provides the users instructions and a button to start the game.*
- [X] *User Controlled Object - An object which the user controls manually.*
- [X] *End State - The game must end by some method (lives, timer, running out of gas, etc).*
- [X] *Obstacles (min x 2) - A minimum of two different types of obstacles for the user to avoid. (ex, the random driving car is one, make another)*
- [X] *Progression - The game must get harder as time progresses.*



### Level 4 Requirements

- [X] *All of the level 3 requirements*
- [X] *Score - A way to track user’s progress that is displayed at the end of the game*
- [X] *End Screen - A screen that displays the results of a user’s attempt*
- [X] *Replayability - Adding elements of randomness to the game to ensure that it is different to play each time you try.*

- [ ] Extra features above and beyond a minimial implementation of the genre selected
- [ ] Code follows OO principles and architecture
- [ ] User-friendly *input-output forms* are implemented
- [ ] User interface is a pleasure to use

- [ ] Code is efficient
  - [ ] No *unnecessary* repetition of code
  - [ ] *Effective* data structures selected (if applicable)
  - [ ] Produce a *modular program* that is divided among multiple classes. (as required)
  - [ ] No bugs in program
  - [ ] etc.


Overall Program Grade: 4



## Project Management [TC]

### Project Planning
- [X] *UML Class Diagrams are fully complete and match the program submitted*
- [X] *Every attribute and method have appropriate access modifiers*
- [X] *Relationship between classes correctly defined.*

### Program Internal Documentation Requirements
- [X] *Full documentation of code (including javadoc style headers for **every method**)*
- [X] **Code adheres to ICS4UO style guide.**

### Regular Github Commits
- [X] *Regular and meaningful GitHub updates have been made showing daily progress*
- [X] *Reasonable explanations of what was accomplished in the git comments.*
